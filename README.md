# Warning
The EPIC E1000 GX checklists provided here differ from the factory-provided checklists and may be incomplete, confusing, or wrong.   

Per [FAA SAFO17006](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/airline_safety/SAFO17006.pdf), pilots and operators that choose to use personally developed checklists should meticulously compare them to the manufacturer’s checklist and placards contained in the POH/AFM to confirm they are consistent. This action will ensure the pilot has all pertinent manufacturer’s information during aircraft flight operations.
